    <h1>Paragraph</h1>
    <p>A paragraph is a <i>series of sentences </i>that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.

        <b>Paragraphs </b> can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single long <strong> of a general point </strong>. It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of the most important of these is a topic sentence.
