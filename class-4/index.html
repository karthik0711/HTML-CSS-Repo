    <h1>This is Main Heading</h1>
    <p>Erik Solvanger
        Translated by Astrid Alben
        I gather up the lumps in my throat, scrape…
        I gather up the lumps in my throat, scrape
        away my dead skin, moisten my lips
        and wait — crabs come scuttling through
        the mist out of the invisible sea, the distant
        lapping of the early mornings, when the sun
        still clenches the half moon with its blond pelvis.
        The crabs scuttle into my bed pinching their
        claws, targeting my hair, my fingers,
        my hands, ears, mouth and eyes.
        They hide in my skull, lay eggs,
        mate in places filled with memories and pain.
        Crabs are stunning, their flesh soft pink,
        their sweet revenge for the broiled
        dream of my parents — this story without end.
        
        Notes on this poem
        Erik Solvanger and I met in 2003 at a poetry event in Perdu, an Amsterdam poetry venue and bookshop. His debut collection, Simple Trepanations (De Sandwich-reeks, 2004) was about to come out. Erik was studying to be a GP but switched to psychiatry; I was a writer-in-residence at the Rijksakademie, where I founded the art and sciences initiative PARS. We lived at only a short bike ride from each other and in the summer we would take an end-of-day dive in the river behind where I lived, dry off on the jetty while watching the barges go by, swill cider from a bottle, talk poetry, feet swirling the water’s surface – time stretching. Erik left to work as a doctor for Doctors Without Borders in Ethiopia and as a psychiatrist in Tanzania. He inherited the family farm in Zeeland. I moved to London at the time of my debut collection. It wasn’t until last year, when Erik invited me to read at the launch of his most recent collection, Waarom het leven in een witte jas sneller gaat (Why Life in a White Coat Moves Faster, PoëzieCentrum, 2023) that I started translating the poems from that collection now published here. In my experience, a collegial friendship can emerge from the translation process; here, however, the translation came out of a friendship. This doesn’t, of course, change the nature of the poems, which, at their core are grotesque and gruesome, absurdist and dark, which is to say, vital and humanistic – and this is what makes Solvanger’s poems intriguing.</p>

        Two Poems
        from 1: Polo Speaks
         
        
        It is from the margins that we left
        to invade the paper
        like that paved route from Attécoubé
        
        We are roughshod
        
        The rain has done what it could
        to pulp our notebooks
        
        The city’s lines blur
        
        Diesel has declared war on the sky
        The cloud is white as a weapon
        
         
        
         
        
        Come to Earth to face the lions
        we fell into the wrong jungle
        
        we blindfold ourselves
        we cross the highway
        
        we are the only ones who know Tomorrow’s address
        
        when the Round-up1 arrives
        we’ll wrestle
        
        hands against claws
        prey against hunters
        
        daybreak dulled by hissing violence
        
        in this jungle-festooned trench
        
         
        
         
        
        from 3: The Clash
        I replaced my blood with lava;
        no one took my salivations seriously.
        
        My pride towered over me:
        I came to undress life.
        
        Chock-full with madness’ sap the herbs
        arranged the name Tomorrow.
        
        Amid the sharp knives
        and the shining bullets,
        I would have wished for a beacon,
        some improvised act;
        during the drowning, a buoy,
        
        or, even just to get right to it,
        that much-feared clash
        
         
        
         
        
        Tomorrow, too quickly you decreed
        that we were sons of shopkeepers,
        sons of cooks, maids,
        little Fantines, seasonal help –
        
        you think our words
        sound like barking?
        
        You’re getting ahead of yourself.
        Lifted from the bed of speech,
        words have opened a way.
        
        The speaking remains our peril –
        here we are dancing in your head –
        let’s get your tongue out of that vaulted throne room.</p>
